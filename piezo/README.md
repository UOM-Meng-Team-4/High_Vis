# piezo
Contains the STM32CubeIDE project for PD acoustic noise simulator developed by MEng Team 4 2023/2024.
The system produces short 40 kHz square waves every 0.01 s, which is equivalent to twice per 50 Hz mains AC cycle.
# Instructions
The project folders and files are generated by the IDE.

The configuration of the microcontroller timers, peripherals, ADCs and communication interfaces is saved in the stmROS_pd.ioc file. 
This file generates code to initialize them.

The software developed is in the main.c file (Core->Src->main.c) with the main algorithm being written in the "main()" function and HAL_TIM_PeriodElapsedCallback() function.
