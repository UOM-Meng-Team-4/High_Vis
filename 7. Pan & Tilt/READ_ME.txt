stmROS_pt	: Contains the STM32CubeIDE project for the pan & tilt system developed by MEng Team 4 2023/2024.

P.s		: The project folders and files are generated by the IDE and the subsequent installation of micro-ROS.
		  The configuration of the microcontroller timers, peripherals, ADCs and communication interfaces is saved in the stmROS_pt.ioc file.
		  This file generates code to initialize them.
	    	  The software developed is in the main.c file (Core->Src->main.c) with the main algorithm being written in the "StartDefaultTask()" function.
