## Commit Changes Locally
1) `git diff` to see changes that have been made locally
2) `git status` to see branch you're on and files that have not been added yet
3) `git add -A` adds any files to the staging area
4) `git commit -m "message about changes you've made"` commits files to git directory locally. Be specific in changes you've made

## Commit Changes Remotely
Need to do the previous steps before this
1) `git pull origin *branch*` This makes sure you have all changes that have been pushed to the branch remotely
2) `git push origin *branch*` Push files to remote repository
